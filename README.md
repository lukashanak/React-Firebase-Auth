## React Firebase Auth (with React Router v6)
- You can use this as template for your Firebase authentication app
- It also includes routing
- It's code is originally from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k
- I updated the code so it's using React router version 6 (instead of 5) and newest version of Firebase
